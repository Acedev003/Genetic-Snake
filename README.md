# Snakevolution-CLI
 Not the typical snake game. The snake no longer needs you - it grows on its own via simple neuro-evolution mechanics. No external libraries used at all.

 ### Installation

1. Clone the repository
    >`git clone https://github.com/Acedev003/Snakevolution-CLI.git`
---
2. To run the typical snake game using keyboard inputs
   > `python3 keyboard_snake.py`

3. To tain neuro-evolving snakes (via a genetic algorithm based implementation)
    > `python3 train_snake.py`

    and run `test_snake.py` to test the best snake in the training phase.
